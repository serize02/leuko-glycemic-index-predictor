# leuko-glycemic-index-predictor
This project leverages machine learning to predict the leuko-glycemic index, focusing on its significance as a mortality parameter in acute stroke patients. By analyzing clinical data, we aim to provide valuable insights that can enhance patient management and treatment strategies, ultimately improving outcomes for individuals affected by stroke.
